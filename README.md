# Siege-Account-Switcher-GUI
A simple GUI application for the Siege Account Switcher

## What is this?
I spent the entire day making a simple application that allows you to instantly switch between the Uplay And Steam Versions of Siege if you were unlucky enough to buy it from both platforms like me. And if you had to do that, you also probably got pretty bummed out when you had to install the game TWICE to play on both of your accounts.

Well, this Application helps all of that

Based off my earlier (more complex) release of a Batch script, Siege Account Switcher Allows you to change your GAMES' version with a click of button. Don't believe me? Take a look at this.

## How it works
The Steam and Uplay Versions of Rainbow are only different in literally one way.



One File... No joke.



Simply Put, this application replaces that one file with either the Steam or Uplay version of it, automatically starting Steam if running the Steam version, or just Uplay for the Uplay version. This also completely eliminates the need to install the game twice, so you save 80-130GB of space, and if you log into your Uplay version's account manually, you never have to login again! It's pretty great. Just click and Play.



## How to Install
I made this Application an All-In-One (which was a pain, but whatever. I got some coding experience out of this).

All you have to do is simply Run it and if it's the first time you started it you can follow the on screen instructions to get everything ready. Don't worry, you only have to do this once.

After initial setup, you just open the app, click which version of the game you want to play, and Bob's your Uncle. Easy as that.



## But Sonic. Can't I Get Banned For This?
Simple Answer: No

Long Answer: The way I made this Application was by taking the OFFICIAL .dll files that define the game version and simply copying them back. Therefore, no game files were actually modified. They're all the original untouched versions, just copied when needed. The application also closes itself to prevent running in the background while the game is running. It's completely safe.
